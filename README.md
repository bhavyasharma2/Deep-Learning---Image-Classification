# Image Classification with Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning


**Overview**

This project/tutorial focuses on classifying images within large dataset using transfer learning from a pre-trained neural network. Transfer learning involves leveraging a pre-existing model trained on a large dataset and customizing it for a specific task, saving computational resources and time.


**Project Structure**

- Data Examination and Understanding:

 > Analyze and comprehend the dataset, gaining insights into the distribution of classes and characteristics of images.

- Input Pipeline with Keras ImageDataGenerator:

> Build an efficient input pipeline using Keras ImageDataGenerator to preprocess and augment the image data for training.

- Model Composition:

> Compose a neural network model for image classification, considering a pre-trained base model as a feature extractor.

- Transfer Learning Techniques:

1) Feature Extraction:

> Utilize the representations learned by a pre-trained network to extract meaningful features from new samples.

> Add a new classifier on top of the pre-trained model, training it from scratch to repurpose feature maps for the dataset.

2) Fine-Tuning:

> Unfreeze a few top layers of a frozen model base and jointly train both newly-added classifier layers and the last layers of the base model.

> Fine-tune higher-order feature representations in the base model for the specific task.

- Training and Evaluation:

> Load the pre-trained base model and weights.

> Stack classification layers on top of the base model.

> Train the model using the prepared dataset.

> Evaluate the model's performance.


**Two Key Achievements**
- Implemented feature extraction for image classification, leveraging a pre-trained model to extract meaningful features and training a new classifier for a specific dataset.
  
- Applied fine-tuning by unfreezing top layers of a pre-trained model and jointly training new classifier layers, enhancing the base model's feature representations for a specialized task.
